1.0
single script minesweeper
-breaks after 2 loops for some reason
1.1
uses functions instead of 1 script
1.2
added flagging
1.3.1
row and column markers
1.3.2
space for 1 digit, no space for 2 digit
1.4
first square opened can't be a mine anymore
1.5
zero chaining added
- only propagates down and out
1.5.1
zero chain loops runs 5 times
1.6
win when all mines are flagged and there are no false flags (qol, technically unnecessary; enables cheese)
- broke loss detection
1.6.1
loss detection is back
-edge case: if only 1 safe space, all mines need to be flagged, & mines will be duds
1.7
all inputs validated
1.7.1
cleanup & aesthetics
1.8
if only mines are left unopened, win


flaws
1. manual entry of row and col values (clicking is so much better)
2. can keep flagging and unflagging to cheese win
	e.g. if 1 mine unfound, if flag doesnt win, it's safe
3. game stops if input is empty
